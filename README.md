# Hopping-Window-Oil-Prices
As part of my Enterprise Distributed Systems course, I implemented a simple application to demonstrate aggregation over hopping windows on Oil Prices data for West Texas Intermediate from Cushing, Oklahoma.

The application loads 6 years of daily oil price readings and aggregates the data using a hopping window to calculate mean and max values for their respective windows. It also creates a visualization to show the data points and corresponding hopping mean values and max values.

The report for this can be found in the Hopping Window Oil Prices Assignment Report file.
